               Eventually, I happened upon a recommendation for Scrimba.  I checked out the platform and decided it was the best option for learning coding that I'd seen.  I completed the HTML and CSS crash course and discovered that I really enjoyed it.

               Scrimba also opened my eyes to the fact that I could pursue coding as a career.  I decided that it was worth exploring more indepth options.  A friend mentioned the LaunchCode program.<br><br><img src = "images/launchcode.png" alt = "launch code logo"><br><br>I took a chance and applied.  Now I am fully immersed in learning and I am so excited to see where this takes me.
