               My first exposure to coding was when my mom pursued and earned a degree in programming when I was very young.  All I really knew was that she worked with computers and also made things called "flow charts".  I also got to go to college (<em>daycare</em>) with her sometimes.

               Later on, my elementary school taught us short units on programming with Logo in second through sixth grade.  <br><br><strong>If you would like to test it out:</strong>

                    <li><a href="https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple2/#logo" target="_blank">here is an emulator</a></li>
                    <li><a href = "https://learn.adafruit.com/program-logo-on-an-apple-ii/hello-turtle" target="_blank">here is a list of the commands</a></li>

               In high school and early college I was really into jazzing up my MySpace page.

               I basically had no Idea what I was doing.  I would go just find code online and add it into my page to make it do cool things.</p>
