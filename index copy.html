            <h4>In the Beginning</h4>

            <p>
               My first exposure to programming was when my mother pursued and earned a degree in programming when I was very young.  All I really knew was that she made things called "flow charts" using a cool stencil tool and that I got to go to college (<em>daycare</em>) with her sometimes.

               I believe that my school taught us short units on logo in second through sixth grade.  If you would like to test it out, <a href="https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple2/#logo">here is an emulator</a>, and <a href = "https://learn.adafruit.com/program-logo-on-an-apple-ii/hello-turtle">here is a list of the commands</a>.

               In high school and early college I was really into jazzing up my MySpace page.

               <br><br>
               I basically had no Idea what I was doing.  I would go just find code online and add it into my page to make it do cool things.</p>

            <h4>In the Middle</h4>

            <p>
               After some time, I decided I'd like to try my hand at blogging.  I purchased a couple of online courses and watched countless tutorials.  <br><br>  
               <img src="images/TSOlogo750px.png" alt = "website logo">
               <br><br> 
               
               I ended up developing a beautiful <a href= "https://web.archive.org/web/20220523191550/https://thesuccessobsessed.com/">wordpress website</a> and even gained a few subscribers (<em>who weren't friends or family</em>).
            </p>
            
            <p>
               In the process of building the website, I learned a bit about web development.  I also learned how little I realy knew.  I realized that I was completely vulnerable, as I had no idea how my page really worked. I became interested in understanding how things worked behind the scenes
            </p>

            <h4>In the Present</h4>

            <p>
               Eventually, I happened upon a recommendation for Scrimba.  I checked out the platform and decided it was the best option for learning coding that I'd seen.  I completed the HTML and CSS crash course and discovered that I really enjoyed it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Scrimba also opened my eyes to the fact that I could pursue programming as a career.  I decided that it was worth exploring more indepth options.  A friend mentioned the LaunchCode program.  <img src = "images/launchcode.png" alt = "launch code logo"><br>I took a chance and applied.  Now I am fully immersed in learning and I am so excited to see where this takes me.
            </p>

            <h4>In the Future</h4>

            <p>
               I am not positive where I am headed.  I am very interested in app development and I also have a soft spot for developing websites.  We shall see.
