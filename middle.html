               After some time, I decided I'd like to try my hand at blogging.  I purchased a couple of online courses and watched countless tutorials.  <br><br>

               I ended up developing a beautiful <a href= "https://web.archive.org/web/20220523191550/https://thesuccessobsessed.com/" target="_blank">wordpress website</a> and even gained a few subscribers (<em>who weren't friends or family</em>).

               In the process of building the website, I learned a bit about web development.  I also learned how little I realy knew.  I realized that I was completely vulnerable, as I had no idea how my page really worked. I became interested in understanding how things worked behind the scenes
